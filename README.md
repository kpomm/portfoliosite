# Lab 1

This is my site for lab 1. It is a website about the groundbreaking woter, an alternative for water. In this part of the lab I worked a lot on the css and restructuring my html for better structure. I added images, and added a few subtle transitions. 

I am using my late day.

## What Worked Well
For part 1 I think that the structuring worked pretty well. I feel like I have a good grasp of HTML and semantic labelling, and that was the majority of the first part of the lab. I think I did a pretty good job with my classes and ids, and I think I mimicked the structure of the website effectively. 
For the second part of the lab I really enjoyed working with the flexboxes and percentages, and found them to be very intuitive. I also really liked being creative with the content and pictures-- I attached the links below by the way. 


## What Didn't
For part 1 I think arranging elements horizontally tripped me up a little bit-- I was not sure if I should use a list or a set of nested divs. I ultimately opted for a list, but recognize it could go either way because of the css. I think it was also hard to think of the website visually as I was working through the HTML, but it was a learning curve that I adjusted to. 
For part 2, I think the hardest hurdle I had was the figuring out the nav bar!!!!! I found myself relying very heavily on a tutorial (https://unused-css.com/blog/css-only-hamburger-menu/) which is cited in both the html and css. However, I feel like I learned a lot and it was a good experience getting acquainted with more complicated html and css elements.
